## What this tool delivers

- **Purpose-built Service Improvement Plan** for Azure App Services subscriptions, combining configuration, security, reliability, and lifecycle signals in one narrative.
- **AI-assisted executive briefing** that triages the riskiest findings, celebrates compliant areas, and hints at remediation sequencing.
- **Multi-format exports** (HTML, PDF, DOCX) suitable for leadership briefings, customer follow-ups, and engineering deep dives.

In a recent validation run (10 Nov 2025) covering subscription `xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx`, the tool mapped **90 App Service plans**, analysed **272 sites**, surfaced a **73% weighted compliance score**, and highlighted **2,992 active findings** spread across security, identity, availability, monitoring, and configuration categories. The HTML tour (see `SIP-xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-20251110.html`) illustrates the dashboards and tables referenced below.

## Who should use it

- Azure App Services CSMs, program managers, and account teams preparing executive readouts.
- Support engineers and SMC leads needing rapid situational awareness before remediation calls.
- ESME App Services partners delivering health reviews to global customers.

## What makes it different

- Built end-to-end with **Visual Studio GitHub Copilot** in partnership with **ESME App Services subject-matter experts**, ensuring domain-aligned guidance.
- Field testing shows faster production of actionable talking points and clearer improvement tracking versus manual spreadsheets.
- Lightweight desktop footprint: self-contained executable, no additional runtime install required for end users.

## How to run it

> Tip: connect to the Microsoft corporate network (VPN when remote) before launching so Kusto queries succeed on the first attempt.

### Option 1 – One-click desktop experience (recommended)

Place the packaged executable (for example `SIPviaAIClient.exe`) on your workstation and launch from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\SIPviaAIClient.exe --subscription "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
```

This produces the full report set with deterministic narratives (no Azure AI prompt is triggered). The packaged build is self-contained, so no additional .NET installation is needed on the workstation.

Add Azure AI analysis when you want the executive recap generated by GPT-4o:

```powershell
.\SIPviaAIClient.exe --subscription "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" --ai
```

### Option 2 – Run from source (engineering teams)

If you cloned the repository and have the .NET 8 SDK installed, you can execute directly:

```powershell
dotnet run -- -s "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
dotnet run -- -s "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" --ai
```

## Parameter quick reference

- `--subscription` / `-s` – **Required.** Azure subscription GUID to analyse.
- `--ai` – Optional. Adds Azure AI Foundry “SIPviaAIAutomationESME” authentication to produce the AI executive recap.
- `--output` / `-o` – Optional directory for exports (defaults to working folder).
- `--format` / `-f` – Optional export selection (`html`, `pdf`, `word`, `all`). Repeat flag for multiple.

## Access prerequisites (keep it minimal)

- Reader permission on Kusto cluster `wawseus.kusto.windows.net` (database `wawsprod`) plus any cross-cluster sources announced in the console.
- Reader access to the target subscription.
- AI-enabled runs require access to the Azure AI Foundry project **SIPviaAIAutomationESME**.

Missing something? Reach out to **ESME-AppServices@microsoft.com**. The team can help provision access or, if time-sensitive, generate the report for you.

## Proven impact & current testing status

- Internal pilots confirm measurable improvement in how quickly customer-facing teams can communicate compliance posture and next steps.
- The beta is still labeled **“In Testing”**; functionality is stable, but feedback is welcome while we finalise UX polish and automation.

## Handle the outputs carefully

- Treat each HTML/PDF/DOCX package as confidential until ESME declares go-live readiness.
- **Do not distribute externally** without an explicit review by ESME—reports surface sensitive subscription insights.

## What’s next

1. Investigating a secure hosted option so users can request SIPs without direct Kusto or AI permissions.
2. Until then, continue using the desktop executable with the minimal Reader access above, or ask **ESME-AppServices** for an assisted run.

Stay tuned for release updates and keep the feedback coming as we refine the experience.
