# SIPviaAI Azure App Services, Service Improvement Plan Beta v1.0 (In Testing) – Field Brief

SIPviaAI is a beta desktop tool that blends live Kusto telemetry with Azure AI based algorithm to produce a customer-ready Azure App Services, Service Improvement Plan—complete with weighted compliance score, prioritized risks, AI-authored executive briefing, and exportable HTML/PDF/DOCX reports—while optional AI insights remain gated until broader rollout, with ESME App Services available to help teams run or review outputs.

## What this tool delivers

- **Purpose-built Service Improvement Plan** for Azure App Services subscriptions, combining configuration, security, reliability, and lifecycle signals in one narrative.
- **AI-assisted executive briefing** that triages the riskiest findings, celebrates compliant areas, and hints at remediation sequencing.
- **Multi-format exports** (HTML, PDF, DOCX) suitable for leadership briefings, customer follow-ups, and engineering deep dives.


## What makes it different

- Built end-to-end with **Visual Studio GitHub Copilot** in partnership with **ESME App Services subject-matter experts**, ensuring domain-aligned guidance.
- Field testing shows faster production of actionable talking points and clearer improvement tracking versus manual spreadsheets.
- Lightweight desktop footprint: self-contained executable, no additional runtime install required for end users.

### Option 1 – One-click desktop experience (recommended)

Place the packaged executable (for example `SIPviaAIClient.exe`) on your workstation and launch from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\SIPviaAIClient.exe --subscription "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
```

This produces the full report set with deterministic narratives (no Azure AI prompt is triggered). The packaged build is self-contained, so no additional .NET installation is needed on the workstation.

Add Azure AI analysis when you want the executive recap generated by GPT-4o:

```powershell
.\SIPviaAIClient.exe --subscription "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" --ai
```

### Option 2 – Windows Command Prompt (cmd) 

```command line
SIPviaAIClient.exe --subscription "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
SIPviaAIClient.exe --subscription "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" --ai
```

## Parameter quick reference

- `--subscription` / `-s` – **Required.** Azure subscription GUID to analyse.
- `--output` / `-o` – Optional directory for exports (defaults to working folder).

## Proven impact & current testing status

- Internal pilots confirm measurable improvement in how quickly customer-facing teams can communicate compliance posture and next steps.
- The beta is still labeled **“In Testing”**; functionality is stable, but feedback is welcome while we finalise UX polish and automation.
